        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I wish I had a better story for how I developed this great pecan pie recipe, besides that I adapted it from one I saw in a Food & Wine article, which according to some guy I donâ€™t remember, may have won a prize in the Texas State Fair. Like I said, the story needs some embellishing.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, this is my idea of the perfect pecan pie. It has the perfect ratio of crunchy nuts to the sweet, sticky goodness underneath. And thanks to the blind-baking, the crust is wonderfully crisp.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>9 1/2 inch pie dish and prebaked shell</li>
            <li>2 cups pecan halves</li>
            <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light corn syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp fine salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>1 tbsp bourbon</li>
            <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
            <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter, sugars, corn syrup together.</li>
            <li>Mix in pecans when it starts boiling, cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in milk, then eggs one at a time</li>
            <li>Lastly, add bourbon and flour</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 for 60-75 minutes</li>

        </ol>
